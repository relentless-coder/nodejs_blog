# nodejs_blog 

Blog platform written in native nodejs.

### About
I intially wrote CMS using MEAN stack, but it wasn't SEO friendly, so instead I used one of my repositories to setup a monolithic software. Most of the backend is built on top of [nodejs-native-rest-apis](https://github.com/relentless-coder/nodejs-native-rest-apis.git).
